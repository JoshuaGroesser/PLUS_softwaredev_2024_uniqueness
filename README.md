First, I downloaded the files which we should recreate.
I decided to use the first file to practice recreation by just reading in the file:
<img width="611" alt="EnvCreat_1" src="https://github.com/JoshuaGroesser/PLUS_softwaredev_2024_uniqueness/assets/162980715/a88183ca-f7d6-4253-a55a-508457b4e154">
<img width="649" alt="EnvCreat_2" src="https://github.com/JoshuaGroesser/PLUS_softwaredev_2024_uniqueness/assets/162980715/56cb97e7-e0cd-4e8b-9f99-1d62c72545b3">
So, creating the environment seemed to work. However, when I tried to activate the environment, I got an error:
<img width="656" alt="EnvCreat_3" src="https://github.com/JoshuaGroesser/PLUS_softwaredev_2024_uniqueness/assets/162980715/be591469-ec2a-41b5-ba99-2580fa883630">
Maybe this is due to the space in the file directory. However, I was not really able to change this and thus could not try if this is really the problem.

For the second file I tried to create the environment "from scratch"
<img width="656" alt="EnvCreat1" src="https://github.com/JoshuaGroesser/PLUS_softwaredev_2024_uniqueness/assets/162980715/f3b1012d-4c7b-4cf2-99d9-c17b71d39af0">
However, this lead to the same problems as with the first environment.
